## About this project
*StatePark API* is a .Net 5 web API. This project was created as an [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com) weekly independent project. 

This application provides two endpoints: a parks endpoint that returns a list of Oregon State Parks, and a Regions endpoint that returns a list of Park regions. 

## Technologies Used

This site incorporates the following frameworks and languages:

- C#
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 4
- .NET Core + Entity Core
- Git
- MySQL & MySQL Workbench
- Postman

## Accessing this application

### Pre-installation

Before downloading project files, you must have the following tools installed:

- You should know to open a command line on your operating system. [Here's a beginner's guide if you don't know what that means.](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
- Git | [Instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- .NET | [Instructions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro)
- MySQL Community Server & MySQL Workbench | [Instructions](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql)   

### Downloading the application

- Open your command line and clone this project with the following instruction: `$ git clone https://www.github.com/meilar/StatePark.Solution`
- Open the project folder in a file browser. Navigate to the `StatePark` folder.
- Create a new file named `appsettings.json`, and insert this block of code. Make sure to enter the userid and password you set up when installing MySQL Community Server in the brackets:
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=state_park;uid={YOUR USER ID HERE};pwd={YOUR PASSWORD HERE};"
  }
}
```

### Starting the application

- Navigate to the project folder in your Terminal with the following command: `cd StatePark.Solution/StatePark`
- Install project dependencies with the command `dotnet restore`
- Confirm that the project builds successfully with the command `dotnet build`
- Start the database with the command `dotnet ef dabase update`
- Start the application with the following command: `dotnet run`
- Full CRUD access is available by making API calls to the two endpoints:
  - localhost:5000/api/parks
  - localchost:5000/api/regions.

## Further Exploration

- A good faith effort was made to use an Entity Framework extension to load seed data into the database by parsing a CSV file. The package that I used turned out to be not fully compatible with .Net5 projects, and it didn't work. The next steps that I would like to take are adding query parameters to the parks endpoint to allow the user to search by nearest city or by park name.
